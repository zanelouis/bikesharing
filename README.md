## Exploring Citi Bike Data
In this module, a dashboard is created using Python to explore data related to the city bike share systems of New York City that will help us predict the customer breakdown in Des Moines. A csv file is imported, read, formatted and exported using Python and then loaded into Tableau Public to publish a story with data visualiztions online.

## Datasets
Data for the peak usage hours for the month of August will help our investors get a ballpark estimate of how many bikes we might need in Des Moines with columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
* Gender
* Birth Year

## Files
* 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv

The program was written using:
* Tableau
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy, Pandas and Datetime
